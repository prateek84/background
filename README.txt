Background
=============

In the simplest terms, Background provides tools to add background images to user pages as well as admin pages using the css "background" property.  Modules implementing background can use their own interface for image uploads.

Configuration Page
------------------

On the configuration page, you can configure which image/colour to use as your background. You can also provide css settings for the css selector as well as each css "background" property.
